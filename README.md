# Optimization of Deep Learning Precipitation Models Using Categorical Binary Metrics

Code complementing this [publication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001909)

Main model is `unet.py` and differentiable loss functions are defined inside `categorical_losses`.

ERA5 reanalysis data to reproduce the experiments can be downloaded [here](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-reanalysis)
